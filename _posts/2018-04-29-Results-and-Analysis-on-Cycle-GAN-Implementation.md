## Check lists for Cycle GAN

We have come a long way from where we've started. Lets see what we have done till now and also watch out for upcoming stuff!

- [x] Understanding & Implementing - Convolutional Neural Networks.
- [x] Understanding & Implementing - Simplified Generative Adversarial Networks.
- [x] Theory behind cycle consistent image 2 image translation with GANs.
- [x] Implementing Cycle GAN from scratch.
- [ ] Analyzing different datasets with our network.
